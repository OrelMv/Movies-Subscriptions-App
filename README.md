# Movies And Subscriptions Management Applications

### Introduction
- This project allows users, who registered to the system, to manage the movies subscribtions of the members in the website. Think of it like theater system: the users are the workers and the members are the customers who want to see the movie.\
- To register to the website you must get an invitation from the system admin - his job is to fill the user information and give him a username, with that he choose a password.
- Every user has various permissions determined by the system admin (like add movie, edit movie, add member, edit member...)
