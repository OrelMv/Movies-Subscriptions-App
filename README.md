# Movies And Subscriptions Management Applications

### Introduction
- This project allows users, who registered to the system, to manage the movies subscriptions of the members in the website. Think of it like a theater system: the users are the workers that their job is to register the customers for a movie, and the members are the customers who want to see the movie.
- To register to the website you must get an invitation from the system admin - his job is to fill the user information and give him a username, with that- user choose a password.
- Every user has various permissions determined by the system admin (like add movie, edit movie, add member, edit member etc...)
- My incentive for building this project is to learn and get a good practice on React.js, Node.js and MongoDB technologies.
